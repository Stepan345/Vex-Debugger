# Vex-Debugger
Hello, this is an in-development vex v5 API debugging tool. This project strives to replicate the default vex v5 namespace with features that allow for simple testing.

# Important:
This is NOT a compiler. This is a header file which contains the vex namespace. This is not for uploading your code into the vex, but instead for checking if your code does what you want it to do.
